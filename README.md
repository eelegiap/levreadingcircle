# Welcome to Lev Anti-Racism Reading Circle (LARRC)!

## What is the purpose of LARRC?
- Provide **resources, accountability, and direction** for students who want to read and learn about **institutionalized racism in the US**
- Create a **nonjudgmental, supportive, and inclusive space** for meaningful discussion, questions, and education
- Connect topics from history to the current situation
- Serve as a springboard or contextualizing space for **getting tangibly involved** with the ongoing fight for racial justice and equality

## How does it work?
* Discussion meets once a week **over Zoom**, typically on Sundays
    * Zoom link here: TBD
* There will be a list of readings (and other resources) for each week's discussion
    * Readings will be **short form**: articles and papers
    * The discussion questions are meant to be a guide
* During discussion, we will
    * **ask and discuss critical questions** raised by the readings
    * **engage with difficult topics** in an open and understanding way
    * try to **understand how the history has shaped current situations and mindsets**
